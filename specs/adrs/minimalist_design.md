# Minimalist Design

### Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board.

* Our Pomodoro Timer will have a minimalist design that comprises of a timer, tasklist, and settings.
* [Pomofocus'](https://pomofocus.io/) minimalistic design of their site was one of our influences when creating our prototype and early wireframes
* We will allow the user to choose a blank minimal background or a minimal beach background in the setting page.

### Decision Reasonings

* We want a minimal design so that users won't be distracted and so it follows the origninal pomodoro philosophy
* We are allowing a minimal beach background option so that it can tie into our theme of SpongeBob Squarepants
