# Darkmode & Lightmode Toggle for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted

* Date: 2021-03-07

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide how to implement a toggle so the user can switch between a lightmode and darkmode. Should we use a single button to toggle or should there just be two buttons for light and dark? **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Single Toggle Button] - Single button that switches to opposite mode on click.
* [2 Buttons for Each Mode] - Each button has an image that shows whether it's light or dark mode.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "2 Buttons for Each Mode", because this deicision was made in the final sprint it is the simplest method to implement. It also provides a visual for the user.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Single Toggle Button

* Good, because it reduces button clutter
* Bad, because it would potentially take longer to implement, could cause trouble with testing

### 2 Buttons for Each Mode

* Good, because it is the straight forward solution
* Bad, because it requires an extra button
