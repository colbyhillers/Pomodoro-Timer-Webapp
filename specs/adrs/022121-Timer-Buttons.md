# Buttons for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Liam and Harry
* Date: 2021-02-21

## Context and Problem Statement

We need want to decide what buttons we need to have under the timer for the user to work it. How many and what type of buttons will the user need? **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Emergency Stop Button] - Implement a button that allows for the user to exit from timer in case something urgent comes up
* [Add Cycle Button] - Implement a button that allows user to add cycle if they think the timer is going to run out
* [Finished Early Button] - Implement a button that allows user to finish their task early and move onto next task

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option(s): "[Emergency Stop Button], [Add Cycle Button], [Finished Early Button]", we felt that all these buttons are equally relevant to the user so they should all be implemented. However, the Emergency Stop and Finished Early buttons will only appear when the timer is active.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Emergency Stop Button

* Good, because it allows user to exit timer if something more urgent pops up
* Good, because it allows user to reset timer if they make a mistake on their tasks
* Bad, because it could potentially clutter screen

### Add Cycle Button

* Good, because allows user give themself more time to finish task if they underestimated their work

### Finished Early Button

* Good, because it allows user to start next task right away
* Good, because user won't have to reset timer if they finish a task a few cycles early
