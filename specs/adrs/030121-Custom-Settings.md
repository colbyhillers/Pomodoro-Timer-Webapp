# Custom Settings for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Liam and Evan
* Date: 2021-03-01

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide what parts we want to allow the user to customize. Should we let them customize cycles? Should we let them disable buttons? **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Customize Cycles] - Allow user to choose how long they want the Work, Short, and Long times to be.
* [Disable Buttons] - Allow user to disable buttons such as the emergency stop.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option(s): "[Customize Cycles], [Disable Buttons]", we felt that both these options were would benefit the user greatly as custom cycles allows the user to adjust the pomodoro to their study habits if they don't want to follow the standard pomodoro philosophy. Additionally, disabling the emergency stop button as an option could let the user choose if they want to eliminate that as a potential distraction.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Customize Cycles

* Good, because it allows user to customize timer to their study habits
* Good, because if the user is short on time they can set up mini-cycles for themself
* Bad, because some users may set times too long or too short because they don't know how long they can focus for

### Disable Buttons

* Good, because it allows user to remove distraction from screen
* Good, because user can prevent themself from ending early if they get distracted
* Bad, because if user does have emergency they have to leave timer running until tasks are finished
