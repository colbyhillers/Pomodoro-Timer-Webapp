# Design for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Colby and Bryan
* Date: 2021-02-28

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide what style/theme we want the pomodoro timer to have. Should we do a minimalistic design or should we incorporate nature or some other theme. **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Minimalistic] - Use a very simple minimalistic theme with no images, [Pomofocus'](https://pomofocus.io/) gave us inspiration for this idea
* [Naturistic] - Potentially have the background be trees or mountains
* [Beach] - Have a water/beach style for the background

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option(s): "[Minimalistic]", we felt that out of all the design choices, minimalistic is the best because it follows the pomodoro philosophy by not distracting the user as other themes/styles might.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Minimalistic

* Good, because it is simple to implement into the CSS files
* Good, because it has a very modern look to it
* Bad, because some users could view it as boring

### Naturistic

* Good, because it adds a twist that few other pomodoros have
* Good, because it can relax the user while they're on a break
* Bad, because it has potential to distract a user while they work

### Beach

* Good, because it adds a twist that few other pomodoros have
* Good, because it can relax the user while they're on a break
* Good, because it follows our team's theme(Spongebob)
* Bad, because it has potential to distract a user while they work
