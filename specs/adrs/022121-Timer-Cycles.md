# Time Cycles for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Liam and Harry
* Date: 2021-02-21

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on what time intervals to use for the pomodoro timer. Which intervals would be most effective for helping the user focus on work?

## Considered Options

* [Standard] - Default Work Time: 25 minutes, Default Short Break Time: 5 minutes, Default Long Break Time: 8 minutes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Standard", because the work time and short break are standard for any pomodoro timer; however, we chose to do 8 minutes for the long break so give the user more timer to relax, but not enough time for them to get distracted from the task at hand.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Standard

* Good, because it keeps user focused on task even while they're on a long break
* Good, because follows the philosophy of the pomodoro timer
* Bad, because if user has a lot of tasks they may get burnt out because breaks aren't long enough
