# Tasklist Organization for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Evan and Yuying
* Date: 2021-02-21

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide how we want to organize the tasklist of the pomodoro timer. Things that we should consider are what tabs we want to display for tasks and in what order they should be. **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Running Task] - Displays running task
* [Upcoming Tasks] - Shows tasks that the user has queued up
* [Finished Tasks] - Shows the tasks that the user has completed
* [Add Task] - Section in tasklist for user to add task

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option(s): "[Running Task], [Upcoming Task], [Finished Tasks], [Add Task]", we felt that all of these options were necessary for the user. However, the running task would be displayed on the main timer page rather than on the tasklist

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Running Task

* Good, because it serves as a reminder for what the user is working on
* Good, because makes the main timer page not look as empty as it would without
* Good, because it also displays what cycle the user is on for that task

### Upcoming Tasks

* Good, because it shows what the user has left to work on
* Good, because it user can leave the site when they finish a task and come back without having to enter their next task
* Bad, because if too many task are entered there is potential for clutter

### Finished Tasks

* Good, because it provides a history of the work that the user has completed
* Good, because it gives user a sense of accomplishment seeing tasks completed
* Bad, because it has potential to clutter the tasklist

### Add Task

* Good, because it is a necessity for the user to add tasks
