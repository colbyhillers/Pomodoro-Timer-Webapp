# File Structure for Pomodoro Timer

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Daniel and Evan
* Date: 2021-02-22

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on a way to structure our files so we keep some form of organization throughout our time working on the project. Should we split all components of the timer into their own separate html, css, and javascript files? **Note: Most of these decisions were made at the beginning/middle of the project on our Miro board(See link below).**

## Considered Options

* [Separate Files for Components] - For each component, it will have a html, css, and javascript file.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option(s): "[Separate Files for Components]", we felt that this was the best way to structure our files because it allows each team to work on their section while keeping the components connected.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Separate Files for Components

* Good, because it reduces the amount of merge conflicts on GitHub since files are separated and not combined
* Good, because teams can work asynchrously 
* Bad, because it can be hard to navigate files if we add too many components
