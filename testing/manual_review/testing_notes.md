## Notes from Manual testing:

#### Debateable "bugs":

After clicking Finished Early, the Add Cycle button disappears. However, if you open and close the tasklist, the Add Cycle button reappears.

Allowing the user to input floating point numbers can make the timer display look terrible

#### Site breaking bugs

If you are on a cycle where a task should end and during the break open then close the tasklist THEN refresh the page, the timer will not leave the break cycle without clicking emergency stop.
