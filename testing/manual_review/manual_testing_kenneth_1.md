Tester: Kenneth Shin

Time Tested: 3-17-2021, approx. 1:20 AM PST

Bug: As shown in the video, when you finish a cycle and then refresh the page during the break period, it will increment the cycle numbers for the task without actually counting the work cycle you just did. Therefore, a completed work cycle is essentially lost when refreshing before the corresponding break also completes (but does not break site).
