-Make sure everyone's added to the group repo (including TA as "administrative collaborator")

-Figure out who can work on team page (HTML experienced people prob preferred), as well as who can come up with a good brand/values. Or maybe leaders should do that
-Figure out who can work on video
-Figure out team contract (no need to finish it all during the meeting, people can come up with suggestions later as needed. Deadline set for Tuesday, everyone signs by Wednesday)
-Start planning out Pomorado
