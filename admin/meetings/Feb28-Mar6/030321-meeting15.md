Agenda:
1. Progress Update
   * Liam: added documentation to files, added events to help task-list, work with timer, changed emergency-stop state 
   * Evan: added 'add 1 cycle' feature for a task, working on finishing a function for timer to actually stop
   * Colby: designing icon and experimenting with background
   * Bryan: working on merged_sprint2 styling
   * Daniel: working on jest tests for js files, presented for Wednesday discussion
   * Harry: assigned to final presentation video, will need voiceovers from everyone and start early for editing
   * Kenneth: upping testing coverage for files
   * Bo: merged branches together in merged_sprint2
  
Decisions Made:
1. Today (3/3/21) is the last day to add in any functionality, like js files, to our product
2. Can only open task list during break or timer_init
3. Remove extend button
4. Add cycle to running task until its up to 5 after that prompt user saying "Task too long. If you want to keep working, make another task during break."
5. Stop timer when pending list is empty
6. Add prompts for user when buttons don't do anything
7. Settings can only open during timer_init

To Do:
* Have everything merged and a finished product by Sunday

End Time: 3:25PM
