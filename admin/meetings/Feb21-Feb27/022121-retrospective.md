Agenda:
1. Think about what went well and what hasn't gone well so far and note it down
2. Group together our ideas
   *  What went well
      *  Everyone finishes their tasks on time and are fairly efficient
      *  The timer functionalities
      *  Miro board discussions are productive
      *  The group doesn't have any personal conficts or hard disagreements
   *  What hasn't gone well
      *  Confusion about the tasks
      *  We lack communication
      *  Keeping up with the schedule
3. Vote on the discussion points 
4. Discuss
   * Lacking Communication

     * We aren't using the scrum channel enough, so we can't gauge where everyone else is at in the project
     * It was hard to tell where everyone was at in the development process, unsure of how this could affect discrepancies
     * People are lacking in creating Agile stories; we typically jump into tasks too quickly
   * Confusion about Tasks
      ![Retirum result for tasks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/801928847279783946/813975780051648552/sprint1retrospective2.PNG)
     * Tasks assigned to people are too large that makes it hard to understand for others
     * Confusion about task summaries and github issues
     * Tasks that aren't a high priority are being worked on while core features still need work done
   * Everyone Finishes Work

     * Everyone finishes their tasks before the end of the sprint
     * We're fairly efficient on completing what we're assigned, it just doesn't get communicated properly

Action Plan:
1. Communication
   * Enforce daily scrum on discord (even saying you haven't done much is still helpful)
   * If you have something to say, try and reach out someone or the whole team so that other people can be informed 
   * Have seperate meetings amongst the developers to talk specifically about development
2. Tasks
   * Assigning smaller tasks to people to reduce confusion and increase understanding of tasks among the team
   * Reassigning people to tasks that have a higher priority 
  
End Time: 8:00PM
