Agenda and discussion:
1. Brainstorming about Pomodoro timer features.
   * Discussion about programming language, agreed to first use Javascript together with HTML and CSS until obstacles arises. 
   * Discussion about "Overstudy" feature.:
     - Liam + Harry (<span style="color:green"> adopted </span>): If task is finished early, "finish early" button can be pressed down. Timer continues, labeled tasks as "finished early". Have a seperate "emergency end" button. 
     - Evan: If a task is finished early and timer stopped by any means, session lost and not recorded.
   * Discussion about notification location:    
     - Liam, Harry, Evan  (<span style="color:green"> adopted </span>): Notifications (contains information such as warnings when sessions are finished early) should be presented as a pop-up window on the timer page.
     - Bo: Notifications should be handled through a the notification system of the browser.
     - Decided also to add browser notification as a extra-feature. 
   * Discussion about splitting tasks when exceeding 4 pomodoro.
     - Evan: Enforce 4 pomodoro session by not allowing user to set the expected required session number to more than 4.
     - Liam + Bo  (<span style="color:green"> adopted </span>): Unlimited session per task, but make clear recommendations for users to split up tasks themselves when creating tasks.
   * Drew basic timer page and to-do list layout drawings. See corresponding frame on Miro board for details. 
   * Discussed about whether to have one page or multiple pages for the timer page, decided on using one page.
