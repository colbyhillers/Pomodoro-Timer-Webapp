Agenda:
1. Brainstorming assignment
   *  Exported miro board as pdf to submit and place onto repo
  
2. Assigning roles
   * Discussed and created goals and roles. See Timer box on Miro for list of agreed goals and roles. 
   * Members picked roles based on interests. Agreed to do exploratory coding based on roles to get a sense of the time needed to implement these features.  
   * Tentatively decided to focus on making a basic timer for our first sprint.
  
3. Created agile Storyboard
   * When people are working on tasks get estimates of how long it takes, how long it took to do it, when they finished, updates, issues, story points 
     - Example posted onto Miro board 
   
Decisions Made:
- Roles chosen based on interests for the timer
- Use github projects for storyboard

To Do:
- Export project specs onto the repo
- Start working/exploratory coding on assigned tasks related to roles
- Add reasonings to current and future ADRs
- Create Discord channels for each role, post updates on them when possible

End Time: 6:25PM
