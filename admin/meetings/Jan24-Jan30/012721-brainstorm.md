Agenda:
1. Divide tasks & begin working on later assignments
   - Group members will self-assign tasks related to the bullet points at the bottom of the brainstorming activity requirement page. Work may be carried out at your own pace.
   - Created a self-assigned frame for members to keep track of assigned tasks.
2. Move ideas & feature notes onto Miro
  - Design UI on Miro 
  - Migrate key information from Google docs spec page to Miro. Pomodoro philosophy moved to Miro board for quick references. 
 
3. Decide on languages we want to use
  - HTML and CSS are decided to be used
  - Java was mentioned for being known by most group members. Javascript was considered not preferable since few group members had prior knowledge. No decision made. 
 
4. Brainstorming:
  - Divided features into core and extra. Decided core features should include Task list, 25 minute timer, and Short/long break. Extra features are decided not to be a focus for brainstorming and early designing.
  - Created page UI idea frame: Task list, Timer, Logging/Analysis, Account Management, and Setting. Decided to focus on the timer page.  
     *  Added reference UI pages and sources to each idea frame as vague and general guidance. 
     *  See frames for details. 
  - Discussed and agreed to implement "overstudy" feature for finishing task early so user can reflect.
  - Decided that basic and normal timer features (start, number countdown, etc), are not shown on core features for clarity.
  - Discussed about and added basic required features: approximation before task starts.
    * Discussed about and decided splitting up tasks that take 4 pomodoro sessions and combining tasks that  take less than 1 session as a core feature.
5. Discussed scheduling extra Saturday meeting to finish brainstorming up. (5-6, 8-10) vote in discord
 
To Do:
- Add any design, or other, idea freely in miro (maybe clarify changes with group first)
- Start thinking about potential tasks you are interested in working with for later discussion about job assignments.
- Put what you’re working on in self-assign box on Miro 
- Add daily scrum channel to Discord, people can say what they’re working on/what they’re stuck on
 
End Time: 3:45PM
